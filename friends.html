These are a few of my best friends, Keeley, Ally, Andrew, and Cody. Me and my friends enjoy hikin, attending concerts,
 and going out to eat. Sometimes we just chill at someones house. Most of my friends have been with me since freshman
 year of high school or even longer. I met Cody in kindergarden, and we've been friends ever since. Keeley and I met in 
preschool so I have known her for pretty much my whole life. Me and Ally met freshman year when were plaeced in the same homeroom.
We had the best homeroom in our class and we are now attentding the same college. I met the rest of the guys through sports like
basketball and track.
