<center> <p> I love to travel! I have been to a few different countries outside the US, including England and Costa Rica. I also seen
quite a few states like Florida,the Carolinas, Montana, New york, and Virginia. I want to visit the west coast next to see
California and Washington. My dream vacation would be to go to New Zealand and hike as many places as I could. I would also
like to travel to dubai and see the tallest building in the world. </p>

My favorite country to visit was Costa Rica. We went ziplining and some of them were almost half a mile long, over a 300 foot 
drop. It was an experience I will never forget. We also saw tons of unique wildlife like sloths, howler monkeys, coatis, and much more. 
We rented out a very nice house overlooking the rainforest. We hiked, drove, and swam all over the country.
